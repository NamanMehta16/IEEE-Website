      The IEEE Student Branch of KLS’s GIT has grown big, throughout the
      years since 1985.As an active student branch of the North
      Karnataka Sub-Section, it has also helped few dormant student
      branches to revive itself and also guided new institutes to start
      a student branch. Earlier, the members of the branch used to
      publish technical papers only. With its member strength growing,
      student activities and student technical symposiums were
      initiated. Gaining experiences from old conferences like GITCON in
      90’s to INFINITY in 2004, IEEE Student Branch has come a long way
      in contributing to IEEE Community. IEEE's core purpose is to
      foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of
      humanity. IEEE is the world’s largest technical professional
      organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of
      humanity. Below, you can find IEEE's mission and vision
      statements.
