              The IEEE Student Branch of KLS’s GIT has grown big, throughout the
              years since 1985.As an active student branch of the North
              Karnataka Sub-Section, it has also helped few dormant student
              branches to revive itself and also guided new institutes to start
              a student branch. Earlier, the members of the branch used to
              publish technical papers only. With its member strength growing,
              student activities and student technical symposiums were
              initiated. Gaining experiences from old conferences like GITCON in
              90’s to INFINITY in 2004, IEEE Student Branch has come a long way
              in contributing to IEEE Community. IEEE's core purpose is to
              foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of
              humanity. IEEE is the world’s largest technical professional
              organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of
              humanity. Below, you can find IEEE's mission and vision
              statements.
